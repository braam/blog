During deployments with WIFI phones, Unify uses the Ascom i62wlan phones with their own branding (Did you known that they run Innovaphone firmware under the hood ;-). Sometimes we deploy them in a network where the wifi wasn't deployed by us. The result can be very stressy because the finetuning / monitoring has to be done by a 3d party. Lucky for us Ascom provides interoperability reports and configuration steps for major vendors, it's located at:
