It is possible to switch off the call list on OpenScape S5 and SL5 handsets. This can be handy if these handsets are part of a group call and donâ€™t want to be disturbed by missed calls on the group.  Bear in mind that missed calls directly to the dect handsets are not shown any more either and the message sign (envelope key) does not light up any more at all.

How to :  press menu-key followed by the code below :
