It's not the first time that I had to connect an PRA to the DIUT2 card on an OSBiz X8 PABX. But I always forget the correct cable mapping between the card and the provider device. Telenet delivers PRA connections with Alcatel Lucent 1462EMC router connected over fiber. See the SLA block to see the correct PAIRS.
